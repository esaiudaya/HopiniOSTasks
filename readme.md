# XCUITest task details:
I have installed and gone through the app and found few bugs in Form screen and listed below

1. Firstname and Lastname value's are mismatched.
2. 2nd Toggle switch  status is not changed at all

## About Framework:
I have implemented Page Object Model, there are many ways to write POM. I have chosen the simplest and robust way to implement it. As of this assignment I have created 3 parts
1. Screen - Which is having all the individual screens and it's state and action, so that we are able to create well organised test cases and are able to reuse each function and elements.
2. Tests - Which has only execution details this class will have readable test cases and able to understand easily each test case what it is performing.
3. Utils - Very simple part has been created for this task but this part will have the framework and other reusable utilities.

I have validated all the scenarios and important UI fields are asserted  with XCTAssert and XCTAssertEqual, to keep quality products.
